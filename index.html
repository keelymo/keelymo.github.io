<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a language professional currently working as an English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher in Boston. I have been teaching English for three years, two of which were in Seville, Spain. While in Spain, I also did some freelance Spanish-English translation work. From my experience as a translator, I began studying software and website<em>localization</em>, a technical term for content translation, through the University of Washington. For the past several months, I have been learning HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python on my own.</p>
